Tristan is a first year MS student in statistics.
He is from Albuquerque New Mexico and did his undergrad at The University of New Mexico in statistics.
He joined the PATHways in Genomic Data Science (PATH-GDS) program because the idea of applying what he is learning and getting a better idea of what he will do in his career is exciting.
