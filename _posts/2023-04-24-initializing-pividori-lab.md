On May 1st, 2023, I'll officially start as an Assistant Professor and PI of the [Pividori Lab](https://pivlab.org/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi), [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
I won't write a long post about this, just saying that I'm very excited about this new stage in my career.
I invite you to keep an eye on this blog, [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/miltondp) and [our projects on GitHub](https://github.com/pivlab) for updates about our research and other activities.

**We are recruiting!** So if your interests overlap with [our labs'](https://pivlab.org/research/), please reach out!
