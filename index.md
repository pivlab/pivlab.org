# Who we are, what we do

We are a research laboratory at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
Our research is focused on developing novel machine-learning methods to advance key computational aspects of precision medicine.
For this, we design and develop computational algorithms and tools that are applied to human disease with a systems biology approach.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our ultimate goal is to advance precision medicine by developing a comprehensive, multi-omics approach to understanding the complex interplay between genetics and disease.
Our research uses the latest developments in machine learning for knowledge discovery to increasingly incorporate the emergent complexity present in biological systems.
By leveraging the power of computational analysis and cutting-edge technology, we aim to unlock the secrets of disease and pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
