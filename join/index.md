### Graduate students

We are excited to welcome students from any of the [graduate programs]((https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs)) offered by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, in particular, those from the [Computational Bioscience Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/computational-bioscience/home) and the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home).

Our teaching philosophy in bioinformatics is based on the philosophy that students need to learn the fundamentals on which modern computational methods are based and apply them in parallel to a real biological problem.
This approach gives both the theory behind a method and insight into what happens in practice when it is applied to a real problem (i.e., how the method deals with noisy transcriptomic data).
This equips students with a deep understanding of all the key pieces, which allows them to successfully apply their knowledge in industry or academia with confidence and innovative approaches.

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [contact Milton Pividori](/contact).
