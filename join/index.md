We are currently hiring postdoctoral researchers, research assistants and software engineers.

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [contact us](/contact).


### Graduate students

Our primary affiliations are the University of Colorado's [Computational Bioscience Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/computational-bioscience/home) and the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home).
Students pursuing computational research from [other graduate, discipline-specific programs](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs) are also welcomed and encouraged to [contact Milton](/contact).

Our teaching approach in bioinformatics is grounded in the philosophy that students should learn the fundamental principles on which modern computational methods are based, and apply them simultaneously to a real biological problem.
This approach provides students with both the theoretical foundations of a method and practical insight into its application to a real problem.
By acquiring a deep understanding of all the essential components, students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to confidently apply their skills to develop innovative approaches in industry and academia.

Please [reach out](/contact) if you have any preliminary questions.
