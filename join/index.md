### Graduate students

We are excited to welcome students from any of the [graduate programs](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs) offered by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, in particular, those from the [Computational Bioscience Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/computational-bioscience/home) and the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home).

Our teaching approach in bioinformatics is grounded in the philosophy that students should learn the fundamental principles on which modern computational methods are based, and apply them simultaneously to a real biological problem.
This approach provides students with both the theoretical foundations of a method and practical insight into its application to a real problem, such as how the method handles noisy transcriptomic data.
By acquiring a deep understanding of all the essential components, students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to confidently apply their skills in both industry and academia, and develop innovative approaches.

Please [reach out](/contact) if you have any preliminary questions.
